A full page wireframe

The Mission

A client needs a new website for her services. The designer you are collaborating with sent you a wireframe*. Your task is to turn this wireframe into an interactive HTML page so that the client can get a good idea if she likes the current structure or not.

Make sure that on tablet and on mobile the layout still works (for example, columns stack on top of each other, etc).

* A wireframe is a schematic representation of the layout and structure of the page. It usually looks all grey. It is used to get approval on the structure, before proceeding with the real design.

Instructions
Choose a framework. For this exercise it's better to start with a component-first framework such as Bootstrap or Bulma, rather than a utility-first framework such as Tailwind.
Using exclusively the classes provided by your framework, try to get as close as possible to the layout provided. Don't write any custom CSS.
Deploy on the system of your choice (GitHub Pages)
Please note: the look and feel of the page will obviously be different. It will match the standard style of the framework of your choice. That's OK!

ðŸŒ¼ Nice to haves
Extra time?
If you used a component-first framework, do the same exercise but with a utility-first framework. And viceversa.

Good luck!
