Welcome to CSS frameworks!
From Bootstrap to Materialize to Tailwind, the world has many CSS frameworks, but what is a CSS framework?

The what
A CSS framework is a library that makes it easier and faster to build a website by providing you a standardized set of elements (for example, buttons, the grid, cards, forms, etc.). Some frameworks also include some JavaScript code to make features such as a carousel work (others only take care of the styling, and it's up to you to add JavaScript functionality).

You use a CSS framework by including its CSS file in your project, and using the corresponding classes in your HTML.

The why
Well, imagine you need a grid, filled with squares, each square has an icon in there and is clickable, you want that grid to be responsive as well. You are propably able to create that with pure CSS, but how long would that take you?
Now imagine for a second that you have a ready set list of classes that you can use to create this, without writing any CSS code... How much faster would that be?

Before you start
During your training at BeCode you will have the chance to use one or more frameworks of your choice.

Look, for example, at this list of popular CSS frameworks from 2021. Bootstrap is probably the most commonly used, though that being said, who knows whether it should be...

I recommend you also have a look at this tech talk by a fellow learner.

Once you feel ready, choose check out Bootstrap (don't worry, you can always change your mind later) and get started with the exercises! Have some experience in Bootstrap already? Feel free to try out another framework.
